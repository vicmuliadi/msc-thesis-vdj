# MSc thesis: Mapping B cell clonal diversity in human breast tumours using Spatial VDJ

### List of scripts used in generating data for the thesis:

**1_format_spatial_GEX_semla.Rmd**: create Seurat object of Visium spatial gene expression (GEX) data with the 'semla' R package using Space Ranger output files, and remove genes/spots with low expression from the data.

**2_spatial_GEX_analysis_semla.Rmd**: downstream analysis of spatial GEX data using the 'semla' R package (normalisation, scaling, find variable features/genes, NMF, cell-type mapping, radial distance of clones from NMF).

**3_format_clone_matrices_mixcr.Rmd**: format clone count matrices generated by MiXCR (but can be adapted to clone matrices generated using other pipelines) so they can be added as an Assay object to the Seurat object containing the corresponding spatial GEX data for a given section.

**4_quantify_clones.Rmd**: quantify total number of clones of each chain type present in each patient and proportion of clones shared between adjacent sections of the same patient.

**5_summarise_VDJ_chain_counts.Rmd**: create a new Assay to plot clones of the same chain type together (e.g. plot all IGK clones in the data).

**6_plot_clones_semla.Rmd**: plot clones using the 'semla' R package.
